# Tower Of States $\alpha$ XX model

We perform a tower of states (TOS) analizes [[1]](#1) of the $\alpha-\text{XX}$ model[[2]](#2). This model consists of an array of $N$ spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ sites with long-range $\text{XY}$  couplings that decay as a power law with exponent $\alpha$,
$$
    \mathcal{H} = -\dfrac{J}{2} \sum_{i,<j} \dfrac{S^+_iS^-_j+S^-_iS^+_j}{|i - j|^\alpha}.
$$

The TOS analysis provides strong evidence for spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) in the thermodynamic limit, as the ground state of a finite system is completely symmetric. The spectrum of the $\alpha-\text{XX}$ model can be labeled by total magnetization since $\left[\mathcal{H}, S^z \right]=0$. 

To perform the TOS analysis, we gather the eigenvalues using either full exact diagonalization (ED) or the Lanczos algorithm in each symmetry sector.

As shown in the figure above, for  $\alpha=1$, the lowest eigenvalues in each $S^z$ sector scales $\propto 1 / N$. In the thermodynamic limit, they collapse into a highly degenerate ground state manifold[[3]](#3). In contrast, for a finite system, the ground state lies in the $S^z=0$ magnetization sector. 

SSB does not happend for all values of $\alpha$. For instance, when $\alpha \rightarrow +\infty$, the system corresponds to a one-dimensional $XX$ spin-chain with only short-range interactions, and so, the ground state is always in the $S^z=0$ sector.
