# Tower Of States $\alpha \text{XX}$ model

We perform a tower of states (TOS) analizes [[1]](#1) of the $\alpha \text{XX}$ model [[2]](#2). This model consists of an array of $N$ spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ sites with long-range $\text{XY}$  couplings that decay as a power law with exponent $\alpha$,
$$
    \mathcal{H} = -\dfrac{J}{2} \sum_{i,<j} \dfrac{S^+_iS^-_j+S^-_iS^+_j}{|i - j|^\alpha}.
$$

The TOS analysis provides strong evidence for spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) in the thermodynamic limit, as the ground state of a finite system is completely symmetric. The spectrum of the $\alpha \text{XX}$ model can be labeled by total magnetization since $\left[\mathcal{H}, S^z \right]=0$. 

To perform the TOS analysis, we gather the eigenvalues using either full exact diagonalization (ED) or the Lanczos algorithm in each symmetry sector.

In the figure above for $\alpha=1$, the lowest energy in each $S^z$ sector clear forms a tower of states. These energies scale as $\propto 1 / N$, so in the thermodynamic limit there the collapse of the tower of states forming a highly degenerate ground state manifold [[3]](#3). As such, in the thermodynamic limit SSB occurs. In contrast, for a finite system the ground state always lies in $S^z=0$, and so it is symemtric (it is also an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian's symmetry). 

SSB does not occur for all values of $\alpha$. For example, when $\alpha \rightarrow +\infty$, the system becomes a one-dimensional $\text{XX}$ spin chain with only short-range interactions. In this case, the ground state is always in the $S^z=0$ sector.
